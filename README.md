# Meraki
Meraki is a comprehensive web application built using PHP, HTML, CSS, and SQL that allows users and artists to interact on a music platform. Users and artists can register and add albums, while users can leave star ratings and reviews (from 1 to 5 stars) for albums. The application also includes an admin panel (admin@admin.com / password: 12) that enables the administrator to manage both albums and users with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality.

This project was developed as part of the Web Technologies course.
